Last Lesson Review:
Examples of IDE are VScode, JupyterNoteBook
We will be making use of Notepad for the following reasons:
-to get familiar with code syntax
-to understand how the code syntax works without auto-completion

HTML - HyperText Markup Language
This is not a programming language, this is just a markup
HTML Structure/Skeleton
	Angle Bracket - <> this is the opening, </> this is the closing
	<!DOCTYPE html>- This basically tells the web browser what type of document this, this is the document type declarator.
	<html></html> - This is the main/root/parent tag of the HTML Document, this hosts everything inside the HTML Document

	<head></head>
	<title></title>
	<body></body> - This contains the visible component of the HTML Document, this contains the content that are visible on the web pages.
	<h1></h1>-<h6></6> - This contains the six heading tags. 

Whatever HTML content we are writing must be inside the tags. 
We can also add attributes to our tags to change the behaviour or add additional features in our Document.

Another thing we will be working with a lot aside the heading tags is the hyperlink tag which is referred to the "anchor tag".
e.g 
<a href="www.example.com>Click me</a>
The href will lead the click to wherever the URL link put is.

How do we actually add an image to our website?
The HTML Document structure provides the image tag.
We just need to add the <img> tag, this tag is a self closing tag, WHY??
Rules to make use of this tag are:
It must include the following attributes to function properly, "src" which means source. We can also make use of the attribute for setting the proper size for the image using "width, height"

link, price, be creative
at least 10 fruits
a more detailed will be available will be available soon.
What is the best practice in adding media such as images to the documents, is it through an absolute URL or relative path
