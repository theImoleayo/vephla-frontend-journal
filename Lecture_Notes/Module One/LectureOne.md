## **Introduction to Front-End Engineering**  

Front-End Engineering serves as a bridge between engineering and product design. It is the branch of software engineering that focuses on what users and customers interact with on a website.

This area involves the **user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)** of web applications:  
- **UI**: The visual components of the site, such as navigation menus, buttons, and clickable items.  
- **UX**: The functionality and interactions that users experience while using the website.  

A **Front-End Engineer** is expected to collaborate closely with other team members to fulfill the product requirements, including:  
- **Product Designers**: Communicate design specifications.  
- **Back-End Engineers and Security Engineers**: Collaborate to build secure and functional products.

## **Ways to Build Websites**  

Websites can be built in two primary ways:  

1. **Content Management System (CMS)**  
   - CMS platforms use a "drag and drop" approach to website creation.  
   - Requires minimal technical knowledge.  
   - Designs are often based on pre-designed templates, which might lack uniqueness.  
   - **Popular CMS platforms**:  
     - Joomla  
     - Magento  
     - WordPress  
     - Wix  

2. **Programming Languages (Web Core Technologies)**  
   - Involves deeper technical expertise and understanding of web development.  
   - Built using the **three core web technologies**:  
     - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  
     - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**  
     - **JavaScript (JS)**

## **Core Web Technologies**  

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  
   - Acts as the skeleton of a web page.  
   - Example websites built with fundamental HTML knowledge: Wikipedia, Jumia.  

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**  
   - Defines the styling and layout of web pages, such as:  
     - Colors  
     - Font sizes  
     - Fonts  
     - Text alignment  
   - CSS frameworks:  
     - Material CSS  
     - Tailwind CSS  
     - Bootstrap  
   - **"Vanilla CSS"** refers to writing CSS from scratch.  

3. **JavaScript (JS)**  
   - Enables interactivity and dynamic features on websites.  
   - Widely used for adding functionality and engaging elements to web pages.  
   - Popular JavaScript frameworks:  
     - ReactJS  
     - NextJS  
     - NodeJS

## **Requirements or Tools for Website Development**  

1. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**  
   - Examples:  
     - VSCode  
     - Eclipse  

2. **Text Editors**  
   - Examples:  
     - Notepad  

3. **Online IDE/Text Editors**  
   - Examples:  
     - CodePen.io

<!-- Additional Notes to Expand After Rewatching:  
1. Provide more details on how CMS platforms differ from programming languages in terms of flexibility and use cases.  
2. Include an example of an actual website or project idea for each of the core web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).  
3. Expand on "Requirements or Tools" by explaining why certain tools, like VSCode, are preferred over others.  
4. Consider adding diagrams or visual examples of UI/UX differences for clarity. -->
