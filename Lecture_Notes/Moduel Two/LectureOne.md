## **Last Lesson Review**
- **Examples of IDE**:  
  - VS Code  
  - Jupyter Notebook  

- **Why Use Notepad?**  
  We will be making use of Notepad for the following reasons:  
  - To get familiar with code syntax.  
  - To understand how the code syntax works without auto-completion.

## **HTML - HyperText Markup Language**
- **Definition**: HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language.  

### **HTML Structure/Skeleton**
- **Angle Brackets**:  
  - `< >` is the opening tag.  
  - `</>` is the closing tag.  

- **Document Type Declaration**:  
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This tells the web browser what type of document it is.  
  - It is the document type declarator.  

- **Root Tag**:  
  - `<html></html>`: This is the main/root/parent tag of the HTML document.  
  - It hosts everything inside the HTML document.  

- **Other Tags**:
  - `<head></head>`: This contains metadata about the document.  
  - `<title></title>`: Specifies the title of the web page.  
  - `<body></body>`: Contains the visible components of the HTML document.  
    - This includes all the content visible on the web page.  
  - `<h1></h1>` to `<h6></h6>`: Represents the six levels of heading tags.

## **HTML Content Rules**
- All HTML content must be written inside tags.  
- Attributes can be added to tags to modify their behavior or add additional features to the document.

---

## **Anchor Tags and Hyperlinks**
- The hyperlink tag is referred to as the **anchor tag**:  
  - Example: `<a href="www.example.com">Click me</a>`  
  - **Explanation**:  
    - `href`: Specifies the URL or location where the link directs.  
    - Clicking the link will take the user to the specified URL.

---

## **Adding Images in HTML**
- Use the `<img>` tag to add an image to your website.  
- The `<img>` tag is a **self-closing tag**.  
  - **Why is it self-closing?**  
    <!-- Consider expanding this explanation after rewatching the lecture. -->

### **Rules for Using the `<img>` Tag**:
1. Must include the `src` attribute (source of the image).  
2. Use the `width` and `height` attributes to set proper sizes for the image.

---

## **Best Practices for Adding Media**
- Should media such as images be added using:  
  - **Absolute URLs** (e.g., a full web address like `https://example.com/image.jpg`)  
  - **Relative Paths** (e.g., a file path like `images/photo.jpg`)?  
  <!-- Add clarification or notes based on further insights from the lecture. -->

---

## **Pending Questions for Review**
1. Why is the `<img>` tag self-closing?  
2. What are the pros and cons of using absolute URLs vs. relative paths for media?  
3. Any additional tips or examples discussed in the lecture?  
   <!-- Expand based on what you find when rewatching the lecture. -->
