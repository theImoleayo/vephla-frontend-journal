## **Synopsis of the Last Lecture**  
The last lecture focused on using the basic tags of an HTML document structure to build a fruit app. It introduced fundamental HTML concepts such as:  
- Document type declaration (`<!DOCTYPE>` tag)  
- Root tag (`<html>`)  
- Head tag (`<head>`)  
- Body tag (`<body>`), which holds the content of the web page

## **Today's Lecture**  
The focus of today's lecture is on the following aspects of HTML:  
1. HTML Elements  
2. HTML Attributes  
3. HTML Quotations  
4. HTML Comments  
5. HTML Formatting

## **HTML Elements**  
HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML syntax structure, which include:  
1. **Opening tag**  
2. **Content**  
3. **Closing tag**  

**Example:**  
```html  
<h1>This is a heading tag</h1>  
<img src="/path/to/img.jpg">
```  

- **Note**: Some HTML elements, like `<img>`, are self-closing and do not require a closing tag.  

<!-- Consider adding more examples of self-closing tags or a table of common HTML elements. -->

---

## **HTML Attributes**  
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.  

**Example:**  
```html  
<img src="/path/to/img.jpg">  
<a href="https://www.examples.com">Click Here to read more...</a>  
```  

- **Explanation**:  
  - `src`: Specifies the source for an image.  
  - `href`: Specifies the link for the anchor (`<a>`) tag.  

<!-- Consider adding examples of other common attributes like `alt`, `title`, or `style`. -->

---

## **HTML Formatting**  
HTML includes elements to format the content of a web page, such as making text bold, italicized, or strikethrough.  

**Examples:**  
```html  
<b>This will be bold</b>  
<strong>This bold is more preferable</strong>  
```  

- `<b>`: Makes text bold.  
- `<strong>`: Preferred for bold text with semantic emphasis.  

<!-- You may want to add examples of other formatting tags like `<i>` for italics or `<mark>` for highlights. -->

---

## **HTML Comments**  
HTML comments are not displayed in the web content.  

**Example:**  
```html  
<!--This is a comment-->
```  

### **Uses**  
1. Hiding parts of HTML code from being rendered on the web page  
2. Writing instructions or explanations in the code  
3. Labeling sections of code for better readability  

**Example:**  
```html  
<!--Example of using an anchor tag-->  
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google Homepage</a>
```  

<!-- Consider elaborating on best practices for writing comments (e.g., brevity, clarity). -->

---

## **HTML Quotations**  
HTML provides elements for including quotations in web pages.  

### **Types**  
1. **Block Quotations**: Used for quotes from another source in a block paragraph format.  
   ```html  
   <blockquote>This is the block quote.</blockquote>  
   ```  
2. **Simple Quotes**: Inline quotes.  
   ```html  
   <q>Believe in practice.</q>  
   ```  

<!-- After reviewing, you could add a real-world use case or example for each type of quotation. -->

---

## **Other HTML Syntax**  
- `<abbr>`: Abbreviation  
- `<addr>`: Address  
- `<b>`: Bold (content continues on a new line)  

<!-- Consider adding a brief explanation or examples for each syntax item listed above. -->
